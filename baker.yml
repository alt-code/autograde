vagrant:
  # Creation of vagrant environment needs a box.
  # You can find list of all available boxes at
  # https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  box: "ubuntu/xenial64"

  # Configure the amount of your host machine's memory that you want to
  # share with the virtual machin (* required)
  memory: "2048"

  network:
#     # You can create a forwarded port mapping(s) which vagrant will set
#     - forwarded_port:
#         guest: 80
#         host: 8080
#
#     # *Note* You can also prompt user to ask for values at runtime. For example:
#     #     host:
#     #       prompt: "Forward VM port to what port on your host machine?"
#
    # Create a private network for your virtual machine and set the local IP for your VM
    # A private network with a static IP is required by Baker server to be able to communicate with your VM.
    # (* required)
    - private_network:
        ip: "192.168.76.90"

#   # Share your host machines folder with your VM.
#   # By default Baker will sync the directory of baker.yml with the VM it creates.
#   # You can configure more sync folders like this:
#   synced_folders:
#     - folder:
#         src: "~/projects"
#         dest: "/projects"
#
#         # *Note* You can also prompt user to ask for values at runtime. For example:
#         # src:
#         #   prompt: "What host folder to sync for projects?"
